"""
The lookup table module keeps the books on all possible hand strengths.
We construct the table once on import and reference it repeatedly.

Number of Distinct Hand Values::

    Straight Flush   10
    Four of a Kind   156      [(13 choose 2) * (2 choose 1)]
    Full Houses      156      [(13 choose 2) * (2 choose 1)]
    Flush            1277     [(13 choose 5) - 10 straight flushes]
    Straight         10
    Three of a Kind  858      [(13 choose 3) * (3 choose 1)]
    Two Pair         858      [(13 choose 3) * (3 choose 2)]
    One Pair         2860     [(13 choose 4) * (4 choose 1)]
    High card      + 1277     [(13 choose 5) - 10 straights]
    -------------------------
    TOTAL            7462

Here we create a lookup table which maps:

    - 5 card hand's unique prime product -> rank in range [1, 7462]

Example:
    - Royal flush (best hand possible) -> 1
    - 7-5-4-3-2 unsuited (worst hand possible) -> 7462
